# GABR_lab_animals

Code for producing the alignments of GABAA receptor subunits between different animals. The input sequences for the `GABR_comparison.ipynb` Jupyter notebook are in the `Sequences` folder, while the output is stored in the  `Alignments` and `Alternative_alignments` (for selected additional sequences of a couple subunits) folders.

The script has been used as part of the following publication:
